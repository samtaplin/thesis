However, the Socialists (69) and Communists (23 - considerable gain), in coalition, had a majority of one over the Christian Socialists. The Liberals won only 17 seats (losing 16). The major issue was the return of King Leopold the Third, which the Christian Socialists supported but the other three main parties did not support. Thus, these three parties refused to enter a coalition with the Christian Socialists, who as a result were unable to form a cabinet. Mr. Spaak of the Socialist party was then invited by the Prince Regent to form a cabinet, and Spaak was thus incumbent for 18 days.

The 2010 elections were held in accordance with the Dayton Agreement of 1995, whereby elections for the House of Representatives are conducted with ethnicity and residence-based limitations to suffrage. Hence this national election was in effect the composite of three federal elections for Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs: the 42 seats are ethnically segmented into three. Citizens who do not identify themselves as Bosniak, Croat or Serb are barred from running for any elections. Generally speaking, parties representing Serbs called for a split of the Republika Srpska from the rest of the country, those representing Croats called for the further division of the country along ethnic lines, while Bosniak parties insisted on greater centralization of the country. These contrasting visions remained the main issues in the 2010 elections.

Though the moderate SDP gained seats from 5 to 8, the nationalist separatist Serbian SNSD and SDS also increased their seats to 8 and 4 respectively. It is difficult to tell whether these elections were a triumph for ethnic nationalists, or moderates. The ethnic breakdown is as follows. Bosniak: In the previous elections held in October 2006, the then Prime Minister Adnan's Terzic Party of Democratic Action (SDA) won nine seats, followed by the Party for Bosnia-Herzegovina (SBiH) with eight.  In 2010, the SDA took 7 seats while SBiH took 2.  Serb: In 2006 the Party of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) in Serbia took seven seats while the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) took three seats. The SNSD� election campaign demanded for a split of the Republika Srpska from Bosnia Herzegovina. In 2010 SNSD took 8 seats, the SDS took 4. This indicated an increase in nationalist, separatist sentiment in Serbia.  Croat: In 2006 the Croatian Democratic Union-Croatian National Union (HDZ-HNZ) took three seats. The Croatians Together (HDZ 1990), comprising dissidents of the HDZ, took two seats. In the 2010 campaign, the HDZ called for an autonomous region for Croats and was in a partnership with the Serbian SNSD to support each other's calls for greater independence. The 2010 results gave HDZ 3 seats, and HDZ 1990 2 seats (no change from 2006).  Moderate: The Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDP), is the only major party that draws support from all three ethnicities: moderate Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats.

They won 53 seats in the Senate and 152 seats in the House of Represenatives. The Action Congress (AC) came in second in  with 18 seats in the Senate and 53 seats in the House of Representatives. And the CPC came in third, with six seats in the former, and 31 seats in the latter. Despite securing a plurality, the PDP actually lost its two-thirds majority in the Senate. The perception was that the AC (despite not winning the election) did significantly better than was expected, and was more successful than it had been in the previous election. The AC picked up seats lost by the PDP, and secured its place as the main opposition party.

The Smuts Party, though considered by the UN as repressive, was in the eyes of the opposition Nationalists, fairly liberal. The Nationalists and their leader Malan were running on a campaign line of strict segregation and secession from the British Empire, and possibly the UN. The months preceding this election saw the break up of some of the smaller parties, so the election was essentially fought by the Nationalists and the United Party. Smuts lost by a slim margin of 224 votes, as the Nationalist (together with the smaller Afrikaners Party) won a majority in Parliament. Smuts lost mainly due to the color issue, with the Nationalist's hardline segregation winning votes amongst the white electorate. Key about this election is that though multi-party, it was hardly democratic - aside from a few thousand colored male voters who were required to fulfil economic and educational requirements that the whites did not have to, the effective elctorate was of European origin.

ALG,615,Algeria,615-2012-0510-L1,2012,510,Legislative/Parliamentary,"Elections to the National Assembly (the lower house of the bicameral legislature) were held in Algeria on May 10, 2012. Following the Arab Spring upheavals in 2011, the Algerian people called upon President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and his ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) to reform and democratize the government. The FLN had been in power since it successfully secured Algerian independence from France in 1962, and most controversially, the FLN proved the lengths it was willing to go to remain in power when it refused to give up power to the Islamist FIS that had won national elections in 1991. As a result, the FIS has been banned from contesting elections in Algeria since then. To pacify protestors President Bouteflika agreed to hold elections, pass an election law in December 2011 (that made it easier for new political parties to form), and expanded the number of seats in the National Assembly from 389 to 462). Despite the calls of reform, these elections resulted in a reinforcement of the status quo, with the ruling FLN securing it's plurality in the National Assembly and increasing its seat count to 221 (up from the 136 seats they had in the outgoing parliament). Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia's National Democratic Rally (RND) retained its second-place position with 70 seats (they had 62 seats in the outgoing parliament). The Green Algeria Alliance (a group of moderate Islamist parties with links to the ruling elite) came in third with 48 seats. And in fourth place was the secularist Front of Socialist Forces, Algeria's oldest opposition party, that ended its decades-long boycott to contest these elections, citing the presence of international observers as a motivating factor. Overall, the voter turnout was surprisingly low, and the international community was surprised that these elections reinforced the status quo, given the recent calls for reform that had shaken Algeria and the Arab world.",no,,no,,yes,,yes,,yes,,yes,These elections were not regular.

For example, Moussa Touati (leader of the Algerian National Front, FNA) criticized the decision to increase the size of the National Assembly, arguing that it was simply a political ploy by the ruling party to make it more difficult for a strong opposition bloc to form in the new Assembly, and thus ensure thei continued hold on power. And some, such as the secular opposition party, the Berber Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) actually boycotted the election. In the lead up to the election, many young Algerians also took to social media and called upon a boycott of the elections. The Independent Youth Movement for Change (MJIC), which had formed from the pro-democracy movement in 2011, also urged a boycott of the election via social networking sites.

The new election law that was passed in December 2011 regulating the creation of new political parties (and the continued ban of the FIS to contest elections) resulted in 44 political parties that contested these National Assembly elections. The new law combined with the increase in the size of the Assembly (from 389 to 462 members) resulted in 30 out of the 44 parties gaining seats in the new Assembly. Thus, even though the two main parties retained their pluralities, the size of the opposition was greatly increased after these elections. ",yes,"Despite the fact that international election observers deemed the elections to have been free, many opposition parties and the public in general, were not very happy with the results of the election. The reinforcement of the status quo came as a shock to many Algerians, who argued that, while there might not have been any outright fraud that was conducted, the political process itself (for example, article 87 of the new election law and the member increase in the Assembly) was manipulated to benefit the ruling establishment and make it more difficult for opposition forces to gain any relevant representation.",no,"I could not find evidence that there were widespread protests following the election.

At stake were half of the 176 directly elected seats (there are 264 seats over all). These 2007 elections were the first held under new constitutional amendments, passes in March 2007, which abolished judicial supervision of elections and banned political activities based on religion. This was understood to handicap the electoral chances of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), an Islamic opposition group banned since 1954. Despite the government�s crackdown on the MB, the group fielded 19 candidates who ran as �independents.� In the lead up to these elections, approximately 800 MB members were detained and two of the other main opposition parties - the New Wafd Party and the Nasserist Arab Democratic Party � declared that they would boycott the elections, due to the unfair constitutional amendments. MB-backed candidates kept a low profile during the election campaign, in the face of a police crack-down. During polling, some opposition supporters were barred from entering polling stations, and some polling stations in MB strongholds were simply closed.   A total of 60 of the 77 candidates secured the majority vote required to be elected in the first round (11 June). The NDP took 59 of these seats while the opposition Tagammu Party took one. In the second round (18 June) the NDP won all 17 remaining seats. Thus the NDP won 87 seats of the 88 contested seats (up from 85 in 2004).

These 2010 elections were for 88 (half) of the 176 directly elected members in the Shoura Assembly, the upper house of the bicameral Parliament. Later in the year, the more hotly-contested People�s Assembly would have elections.  These Shoura elections saw more opposition parties field candidates than usual � in the previous elections, the repressive political atmosphere had discouraged many from taking part. However, a recent constitutional amendment meant that parties must hold seats in either house of the Parliament to field a Presidential candidate (elections would be held in 2011), thus encouraging the opposition parties to engage more fully with these elections. However, the main opposition parties - the Wafd, the Tagammu party and the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party - failed to form an electoral coalition. The illegal Muslim Brotherhood (MB) backed 14 independent candidates. The MB were officially banned, though the media focused on whether the MB would fare well in these Shoura Assembly elections as a forecast of the People�s Assembly elections due in late 2010. The MB reported that its candidates faced growing hostility as the elections approached. Forty of its members were arrested during the campaign, and Mubarak�s security forces used violence to break up opposition rallies. During voting, many opposition supporters were refused access to voting stations. The MB and the opposition Wafd Party accused the NDP of vote rigging.

These 2010 elections were for the lower house of the bicameral Parliament, the People's Assembly. These elections were the first held under the new Constitutional amendment introduced in June 2009 that raised the number of members of the People's Assembly from 454 to 518. Previous to these elections, a pro-democratic movement had slowly been building momentum: in February 2010, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former Director of the IAEA Mohamed ElBaradei launched a campaign calling for change. The Muslim Brotherhood was one of the strongest opposition forces, though it was officially banned (since 1954). Its members were allowed to run for election only as independent candidates. In these 2010 elections, the major opposition parties included the New Wafd Party (NWP), which fielded 168 candidates; the National Progressive Unionist Grouping (Tagammu, 66 candidates) and the Nasserist Party (31 candidates). In addition, 135 MB-backed independent candidates declared they would be running.  In the first round, 209 NDP candidates, 7 independents, and 5 opposition candidates earned the required majority to be elected (no MB-backed candidates). Ultimately in these 2010 elections, the NDP took 427 of the 512 contested seats, and opposition parties took only 16. The remaining 69 seats went to independent candidates, many of whom were considered close to the NDP.

Hence the opposition lost ground.

A major issue thought to have upped the stakes of these elections was that holding credible polls was seen as a key step for Afghan forces towards taking control of the country's security by 2014 in order to allow the withdrawal of US troops. Though the absence of political parties (they are legal, but most candidates stand as independents) makes it difficult to determine the changing lines of support and opposition for incumbent President Karzai, it was thought that his support waned in the outcome of these elections.

Being the main allies of President Karzai (who is Pashtun), support for President was believed to have been reduced in the new legislature. The decrease was partially attributed to the fact that voting did not take place in some Pashtun areas. An analysis of the results by the New York Times concluded that Karzai would be able to count on the support of at least 100 members of the new House.
